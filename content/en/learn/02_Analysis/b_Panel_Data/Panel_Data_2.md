## What is Panel Data

Panel Data has two dimensions:

1. Longitudinal: observasions cross sections (locations, sites, etc)
2. Short: observasions across time.

Sometimes panel data are also refered as logitudinal data, pooled data, cross-sectional time-series data.

But for files not named as \_index.md. It cannot refer to images at the same folder

Yes, if you add an image not in the index file, it's wrong
